Feature Stores offer simple yet powerful state management.

## Key Principles
- **Less Boilerplate**: With the `FeatureStore` API you can update state without writing actions and reducers
- A Feature Store **manages feature state** directly
- The state of a Feature Store **integrates into the global state**
- Feature Stores are **destroyable**

## What's Included
The MiniRx `FeatureStore` API:
-   `setState()` update the feature state
-   `select()` select state from the feature state object as RxJS Observable
-   `effect()` run side effects like API calls and update feature state
-   `undo()` easily undo setState actions (requires UndoExtension)

:::info
**How the FeatureStore works**

Feature Stores make use of Redux too: Behind the scenes a Feature Store is creating a feature reducer and a "setState" action. MiniRx dispatches that action when calling `setState()` and the corresponding feature reducer will update the feature state accordingly.
